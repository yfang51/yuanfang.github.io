**Impact of Price Regulation When Consumers Have Inertia: Evidence from Texas Electricity Retail Market**  
his paper examines the Price-to-Beat (PTB) rule, a unique regulatory mechanism implemented during Texas’s electricity market restructuring. The rule regulated the incumbent retailer’s pricing by setting a margin above the competitive level to promote entry by new firms. Because this design intentionally raised prices, it has been widely criticized. Using rich meter-level data from Texas’s largest service area, I estimate the rule’s impact on retail prices and consumer welfare. I develop a random-coefficient discrete-choice model to distinguish heterogeneity in consumers’ preference for the incumbent and their switching costs. A mover subsample helps identify switching costs, while individual-specific price data allows for direct identification of price sensitivity. The model is estimated via simulated maximum likelihood with nested contraction mapping. I find substantial switching costs that is roughly twice the average monthly electricity bill. On the supply side, I specify a static pricing model in which retailers trade off profit and market share. Counterfactual simulations show that, absent the PTB rule, the incumbent would roughly double its price, while new entrants would increase prices modestly. The PTB rule therefore saved households about $119 per month, which is more than an average monthly electricity bill. Shorter contract lengths would reduce these savings. This paper provides the first structural analysis of the PTB rule and offers new insights into how consumer inertia, regulatory design, and firm strategy interact in restructured utility markets.
